A patch that allows FEZ v1.11 to be TASed

./FEZ
  Contains all of the orignial files of FEZ v1.11
  Probably just a copy of "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FEZ" or similar
  after opting into the '1.11 (Monogame)' beta in Steam>Library>FEZ>Properties>Betas

./FEZ_TAS
  Contains all of the modded files of FEZ v1.11
  Get this started by copying all of the files in ./FEZ again
    the build process will remove any files that will get modded

./MonoMod
  The magic that makes everything happen

./Mod_FEZ
  Contains the code to be injected into FEZ.exe

./Mod_FezEngine
  Contains the code to be injected into FezEngine.dll

./TasRules
  Contains the code that will customize the execution of MonoMod
